Overview
This project presents a hardware-accelerated real-time image dehazing pipeline, fully implemented in Verilog and synthesized on a Xilinx ZedBoard FPGA (Zynq-7000). The goal is to achieve high-performance image dehazing using a custom pipelined architecture based on the Dark Channel Prior and Scene Radiance Recovery methods, optimized for fixed-point arithmetic and real-time throughput.

The pipeline processes BMP images sent via UART, performs dehazing across multiple stages, and outputs the reconstructed haze-free image back to the host.

Motivation
Hazy or foggy images reduce visibility and impair vision-based applications in autonomous vehicles, surveillance, and outdoor robotics. Real-time haze removal is computationally expensive on traditional CPUs. Therefore, we design a dedicated hardware accelerator to:

Achieve parallel processing

Support stream-based pipelining

Enable on-chip real-time dehazing

Reduce latency compared to software-based dehazing

Algorithm Overview
The pipeline implements a hardware-efficient version of the dark channel prior-based dehazing algorithm, inspired by the IEEE TCSVT paper:
"Hardware Implementation of a Fast and Efficient Haze Removal Method".

Key Steps:
Dark Channel Prior Estimation

Atmospheric Light Estimation

Transmission Estimation

Scene Radiance Recovery

Hardware Architecture
The pipeline consists of the following Verilog modules:

1. WindowGenerator
Generates a 3Ã—3 RGB window from a video stream using line buffers. Extracts local regions of pixels for morphological operations.

4 line buffers for storing previous rows

Outputs 9 pixels in parallel (in1 to in9)

Used in both DCP and TE stages

2. DarkChannel
Computes the minimum intensity among RGB values across a 3x3 neighborhood.

Performs per-pixel min(R, G, B)

Then computes spatial min using a comparator tree

Output: grayscale dark channel pixel

3. ALE (Atmospheric Light Estimation)
Estimates the global atmospheric light from the dark channel.

Accumulates the brightest 0.1% pixels

Calculates inverse of A for transmission estimation

Fully pipelined and streamed

4. TE (Transmission Estimation)
Estimates the amount of haze (transmission map) at each pixel using the formula:
t(x) = 1 - Ï‰ * min(min(R, G, B)) / A

Uses fixed-point arithmetic (Q0.16)

Ï‰ = 0.95 implemented as a constant

Computes pixel-wise t(x)

5. SRSC (Scene Radiance and Scaling Correction)
Recovers the haze-free pixel intensities:
J(x) = (I(x) - A) / max(t(x), t0) + A

Handles division using reciprocal lookup

Ensures t(x) â‰¥ t0 = 0.1 (Q0.16)

Performs all math in fixed-point

Outputs final RGB image

6. TE_and_SRSC
A 10-stage pipelined Verilog module that combines both transmission estimation and scene radiance recovery in a single processing core.

Increases throughput by avoiding staging delay

Maintains per-pixel data flow with valid signals

7. Top Module
The complete top-level module connecting:

Register_Bank â†’ DarkChannel â†’ ALE â†’ TE_and_SRSC

Valid signal flow control

Input: RGB pixel stream

Output: Dehazed RGB pixel stream

8. Top_TB (Testbench)
Reads a BMP file, extracts pixel data, drives the dehazing pipeline, and writes the output BMP file with haze removed.

Uses $fread and $fwrite for binary BMP I/O

Handles BMP header + padding

Simulates full dataflow operation
